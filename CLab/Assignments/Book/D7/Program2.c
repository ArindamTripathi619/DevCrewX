/*
The present value (popularly known as book value) of an item is given by the
relationship:

P = c(1 âˆ’ d)^n

where c: original cost
d: rate of depreciation (per year)
n: number of years
P: present value after n years
If P is considered the scrap value at the end of useful life of the item, write a
program to compute the useful life in years given the original cost, depreciation rate
and the scrap value. The program should request the user to input the data
interactively.

OUTPUT :
